1. Make the round-trip selection in flight search configuration smaller

1.1 Change origin airports selection so that it shows all airports not only the most important one for each country. Note that the default selected airport should still be the most important airport of the country the user is located in.

2. Activity Planner (should be the tab next to flight search)
    1. Provide the chatbot with all the information the user already entered, e.g. travel profile, swiping cards, destination country. Then let the chatbot plan 3 unique days based on that information. The computation and API calls should start as soon as the user presses the "View Details" button for the top destination results so that the results for the planned 3 unique days are ready as soon as the user navigates to the activity planner tab. The total costs of the trip should be shown as well as the number of adults and children the trip was planned for (leave out infants because they usually don't cost anything). 
    2. The Translator (Geopy / Nominatim)
        The Problem: Computers and Maps don't understand the word "Paris." They only understand coordinates (Latitude and Longitude).
        The Solution: This uses OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim service. It takes the text you typed in the sidebar and sends it to a free server. The server returns numbers like 48.8566, 2.3522.
    3. The Scout (Foursquare API)
        The Solution: This sends a "GET" request to Foursquare. It says: "Hey, I'm at these coordinates. Show me the top 8 places in this specific category (e.g., 16000 for Landmarks)."
    4. The Artist (Folium & Streamlit-Folium)
        The Problem: Data in a list is boring; travelers want to see a map.
        The Solution:
        Folium creates an interactive HTML map in the background.
        The script adds a Blue Marker for the center of the city.
        It then loops through the Foursquare list and adds Red Markers for every museum or restaurant found.
    5. Connect chatbot to Web Search API, so that the chatbot can search the web for prices. Note the budget should be close to exhaustion but never exceeded.

3. Downloadable results for the activity planner (which format? pdf? google maps?)

4. Input for activity planner: traveler profiles + swipe results + destination country

5. General:
- ask for travel time at the beginning and use for all other applications (i.e. flight panner and activity planner) --> same for number of travelers (note that for some travel profiles we can already infer the number of travelers, e.g. Adventurous Solo = 1 traveler, honeymoon = 2 travelers)

6. Add links for the created google calendar events for the flight booking
