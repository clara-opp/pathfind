1. 3. Add more images to the pictures.json
- Images for Russia (bad images) and Iran (only flag images) definitely need to be changed

2. Connect chatbot to google maps to plan day trips with a fixed budget
- Google Places API: Filter places by price level
    The Feature: Price Level (Ranges from 0 to 4).
    0 = Free
    1 = Inexpensive[1]
    2 = Moderate
    3 = Expensive[1]
    4 = Very Expensive
- Google Routes API: Planning the route

3. Downloadable results for the activity planner (which format? pdf? google maps?)

3.1 Input for activity planner: traveler profiles + swipe results + destination country

3.2 General:
- ask for travel time at the beginning and use for all other applications (i.e. flight panner and activity planner) --> same for number of travelers (note that for some travel profiles we can already infer the number of travelers, e.g. Adventurous Solo = 1 traveler, honeymoo = 2 travelers)

4. Verify if chatbot for flight search works for multiple days and multiple adults, childs and infants

5. Add audio to chatbot for flight search and to the chatbot for trip planning
