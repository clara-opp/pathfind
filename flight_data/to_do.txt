0.01 Make the currently selected button for the sorting of the flights visible by making it darker when selected

0.1 Check flight booking error handling again
- currently the below is not handled: 
Error creating flight order: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/flight-orders
Response body: {'errors': [{'status': 400, 'code': 34651, 'title': 'SEGMENT SELL FAILURE', 'detail': 'Could not sell segment 2', 'source': {'pointer': '/data/flightOffers[0]/itineraries[0]/segments[1]'}}]}

0.3 
- Chatbot does not work for finding flight for multiple persons
- Specifying the airport should be possible (as well as asking the chatbot about the airports in italy, i.e. chatbot should see the flying to list in the manual search)
- chatbot should be able to select the class (economy, premium_economy etc.)

0.4 Restructure the code

1. Connect chatbot to google maps to plan day trips with a fixed budget
- Google Places API: Filter places by price level
    The Feature: Price Level (Ranges from 0 to 4).
    0 = Free
    1 = Inexpensive[1]
    2 = Moderate
    3 = Expensive[1]
    4 = Very Expensive
- Google Routes API: Planning the route

2. Downloadable results for the activity planner (which format? pdf? google maps?)

3. Input for activity planner: traveler profiles + swipe results + destination country

4. General:
- ask for travel time at the beginning and use for all other applications (i.e. flight panner and activity planner) --> same for number of travelers (note that for some travel profiles we can already infer the number of travelers, e.g. Adventurous Solo = 1 traveler, honeymoo = 2 travelers)

5. Add audio to chatbot for flight search and to the chatbot for trip planning
