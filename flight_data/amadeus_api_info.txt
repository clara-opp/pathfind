## Short description of the main amadeus APIs
1. Flight Offers Search: 
You search for available flights and get a list of flight offers, 
each with a unique id. This is the JSON file you have.

2. Flight Offers Price: 
Before booking, you must confirm the price and availability of a single, 
chosen flight offer. You take the full flight offer object from the search 
results and send it to this second API endpoint. This ensures the price hasn't 
changed and the seats are still available.

3. Flight Create Orders: This is the final booking step. 
After the price is confirmed, you send the flight offer along with the traveler's 
personal information (name, date of birth, contact info, etc.) to this third API 
endpoint. If successful, this API call creates a PNR (Passenger Name Record), 
which is the official booking in the airline's system.

4. Payment cannot be implemented because:
- amadeus payment products are enterprise products, i.e. they cost money and require
onboarding + contracting
- for using a payment provider (e.g. stripe) you need strong customer authentication
(SCA)/PSD2 and would need to check regulatory requirements (you need to be a 
registered company to be able to make transactions with customers)
